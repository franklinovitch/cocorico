# Install

## Local Install

The local install is the best way to test the platform and start developing/modifying it. The whole installation process is automated (using Vagrant and Ansible) and will install everything in a Virtual Machine (using VirtualBox).

### Install Procedure

* Install [VirtualBox 4.3+](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).
* Install [Vagrant 1.8.1+](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/).
* `git clone https://github.com/promethe42/cocorico.git && cd cocorico`
* `vagrant up local` (run as admin on Windows)
* Go to [http://local.cocorico.cc](http://local.cocorico.cc) to test the platform. (Automatically added to your [hosts file](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/modify-your-hosts-file) by Vagrant hostmanager)

### VM Management

When the VM has been properly installed and configured, you can:
* shutdown the VM: `vagrant halt local`,
* start a shutdown VM: `vagrant up local`,
* restart the VM: `vagrant reload local`,
* delete the VM: `vagrant destroy local`.

Learn more about the [Vagrant command line interface](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/up.html).

### Uninstall procedure

Simply destroy the VM by running `vagrant destroy local`.

## Troubleshooting

### I get the "A Vagrant environment or target machine is required to run this command" error whenever I run a `vagrant` command.

Make sure you are in the Cocorico project root directory before running `vagrant up`.

### When I run `vagrant up`, I get a "machine is in the 'poweroff' state" error.

Try to run the VM directly from VirtualBox. You will likely get a more specific error.

Most of the time, it's because your hardware/software configuration does not support VT-x which is mandatory to run VirtualBox on Intel processors. If that's the case, try to [enable VT-x](http://www.howtogeek.com/213795/how-to-enable-intel-vt-x-in-your-computers-bios-or-uefi-firmware/).
